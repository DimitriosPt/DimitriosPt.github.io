  <u1 class="about">
    
  <p1> I grew up in Petaluma, CA, The most famous town you've never heard of. Like many Greek American kids, I grew up working
  with the family food business. Somewhere along the way I fell in love with video games which eventually led me down the path of
  pursuing a degree in computer science.<br> </p1>
  
  
  <p2> I attended the Santa Rosa Junior College from 2015 - 2018, choosing to stay home and help run the family business instead
  of running off to college. In this time I acquired 4 assosciates degrees
  (Math, Computer Science, Behavioral Sciences, and Physical Sciences), and made friends and memories I'll never forget. </p2>

    
  <p3> Nowadays I attend Sacramento State and at the time of writing this about section am about to enter my senior year. 
  I've made some great friends one year in and I'm very excited to see what this next year will hold for me. </p3>

    
  <p4> I've also just finished up an internship at <a href="https://sefmicrogrid.com/"> Stone Edge Farms Microgrid Project </a> where 
  I created a machine learning based model to predict future solar generation for the property! </p4>
